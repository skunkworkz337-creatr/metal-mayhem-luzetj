You want to create a mobile app called \"MetalMayhem\" using React Native and Expo 54, designed for reporting real-time scrap metal prices and connecting users with local recycling yards. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Tab 1: Metal Types & Pricing:** A screen displaying a catalog of metal types, their descriptions, common sources, and pricing averages (national, regional, and state-specific).\n*   **Tab 2: Marketplace:** A screen where users can list items for removal, connecting them with businesses or pickup services.\n*   **Tab 3: Business Listings:** A screen showcasing local businesses with their information and contact details.\n*   **Tab 4: Yard Info & Pricing:** A screen providing details about local yards, including accepted metals, contacts, hours, and user-submitted pricing.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f0f0f0` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    *   Text: `#333333` (Dark gray for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#666666` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#2E7D32` (A deep green, representing recycling and value)\n    *   Secondary: `#FFB300` (A vibrant yellow, for highlights and calls to action)\n    *   Accent: `#4CAF50` (A brighter green, for interactive elements)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White for content containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#B2FF59` (A light green, for highlighting important information)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Modify Tab Layout:** Update the `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` file to reflect the four tabs: \"Metal Types & Pricing\", \"Marketplace\", \"Business Listings\", and \"Yard Info & Pricing\".

For example, in `metalTypes.tsx`, add a `Text` component that says \"Metal Types & Pricing Content\". Do the same for the other three tabs, changing the text accordingly.\n4.  **Remove Demo Content:** Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` as it is no longer needed.\n\nAfter I provide this plan, please implement it and modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-02T03:18:58.238360"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create the MetalMayhem app!

Consider using a cloud-based scheduler (like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or a cron job on a server) to trigger the scraping at the specified time. This ensures the scraping runs even if the app is not active.\n*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement robust error handling in the scraping process. Log any errors to a file or a cloud-based logging service (like Sentry or Firebase Crashlytics) for debugging.\n*   **Timezone Considerations:** Ensure the scheduler is configured to run at 11:59 PM CST, taking into account potential daylight saving time changes.\n\nFor the \"Verified\" tag and badging system, you'll need to:\n\n*   **Onboarding Process:** Modify the onboarding flow to collect and verify contact information (e.g., email, phone number).\n*   **Data Storage:** Store the verification status and badges earned by each user in a database (Supabase).\n*   **UI Updates:** Update the UI to display the \"Verified\" tag and badges on user profiles.\n\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-02T04:29:00.439908"}, {"type": "search_knowledge_base"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "services/zohoApi.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "services/scrapingScheduler.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/profile.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "data/messages.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me read a few more files to understand the user data structure and onboarding flow:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/marketplace.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/businessListings.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now I have a good understanding of the codebase.

Here's a refined plan:\n\n**1. AdMob Integration:**\n\n*   **Install `react-native-google-mobile-ads`:** Add this package to the project using `expo install react-native-google-mobile-ads`.\n*   **Initialize AdMob:** In `app/_layout.tsx` (or the main entry point), initialize the Mobile Ads SDK:\n\n```javascript\nimport { MobileAds } from 'react-native-google-mobile-ads';\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n  MobileAds.initialize()\n    .then(adapterStatuses => {\n      // Initialization complete, you can start loading ads\n    });\n}, []);\n```\n\n*   **Implement Banner Ads:**  Create a BannerAd component and place it in `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` or other relevant screens. Use the provided AdMob ad unit ID.\n\n```javascript\nimport { BannerAd, BannerAdSize, TestIds } from 'react-native-google-mobile-ads';\n\nconst adUnitId = __DEV__ ? TestIds.BANNER : 'ca-app-pub-xxxxxxxxxxxxx/yyyyyyyyyyyyyy'; // Replace with your actual ad unit ID\n\n<BannerAd\n  unitId={adUnitId}\n  size={BannerAdSize.BANNER}\n  requestOptions={{\n    requestNonPersonalizedAdsOnly: true,\n  }}\n/>\n```\n\n**2. Profile Tab Enhancements (`app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`):**\n\n*   **User Data:** Since the current profile uses hardcoded data (\"John Doe\"), integrate with the user authentication system (Supabase if enabled) to fetch and display the actual user's information (name, email, phone, location).\n*   **Verified Status:** Add a component to display the user's verification status. This could be a simple text label or an icon with a tooltip.\n*   **Badges:** Implement a component to display the user's earned badges. You can use a grid or list layout to showcase the badges.\n*   **AdMob Section (Optional):** If you want to allow users to manage AdMob preferences (e.g., remove ads with a subscription), add a section with relevant options.\n\n**3. Code Modifications:**\n\n*   Modify `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` to incorporate the AdMob banner, user data, verified status, and badges.\n*   Update the styles in `styles/commonStyles.ts` to ensure the new components are visually consistent with the rest of the app.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n1.  Install the `react-native-google-mobile-ads` package.\n2.  Modify `app/_layout.tsx` to initialize AdMob.\n3.  Implement the BannerAd component in `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`.\n4.  Integrate user data, verified status, and badges into the profile tab.\n5.
