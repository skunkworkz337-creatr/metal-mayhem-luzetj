You want to create a mobile app called \"MetalMayhem\" using React Native and Expo 54, designed for reporting real-time scrap metal prices and connecting users with local recycling yards. Here's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Tab 1: Metal Types & Pricing:** A screen displaying a catalog of metal types, their descriptions, common sources, and pricing averages (national, regional, and state-specific).\n*   **Tab 2: Marketplace:** A screen where users can list items for removal, connecting them with businesses or pickup services.\n*   **Tab 3: Business Listings:** A screen showcasing local businesses with their information and contact details.\n*   **Tab 4: Yard Info & Pricing:** A screen providing details about local yards, including accepted metals, contacts, hours, and user-submitted pricing.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f0f0f0` (Light gray for a clean look)\n    *   Text: `#333333` (Dark gray for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#666666` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#2E7D32` (A deep green, representing recycling and value)\n    *   Secondary: `#FFB300` (A vibrant yellow, for highlights and calls to action)\n    *   Accent: `#4CAF50` (A brighter green, for interactive elements)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White for content containers)\n    *   Highlight: `#B2FF59` (A light green, for highlighting important information)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native feel.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Modify Tab Layout:** Update the `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` file to reflect the four tabs: \"Metal Types & Pricing\", \"Marketplace\", \"Business Listings\", and \"Yard Info & Pricing\". Use the `FloatingTabBar` component for the tab bar.\n2.  **Create Tab Screens:** Create four new files in the `app/(tabs)` directory:\n    *   `metalTypes.tsx` for the \"Metal Types & Pricing\" tab.\n    *   `marketplace.tsx` for the \"Marketplace\" tab.\n    *   `businessListings.tsx` for the \"Business Listings\" tab.\n    *   `yardInfo.tsx` for the \"Yard Info & Pricing\" tab.\n3.  **Implement Basic UI:** Add basic UI elements to each of the four tab screens. For example, in `metalTypes.tsx`, add a `Text` component that says \"Metal Types & Pricing Content\". Do the same for the other three tabs, changing the text accordingly.\n4.  **Remove Demo Content:** Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` as it is no longer needed.\n\nAfter I provide this plan, please implement it and modify the app/(tabs) folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-02T03:18:58.238360"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you create the MetalMayhem app!
